					found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
					weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
					completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers, working as
					a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”

					“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
					needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
					programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
					student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
					The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
					hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
					project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
					next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
					often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
					experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
					developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
